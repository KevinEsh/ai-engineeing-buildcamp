Depending\\non your environment, you might start the interpreter by clicking on an icon, or by typing\\npython on a command line. When it starts, you should see output like this:\\nPython 3.4.0 (default, Jun 19 2015, 14:20:21)\\n[GCC 4.8.2] on linux\\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\\n>>>\\nThe ?rst three lines contain information about the interpreter and the operating system it\\x92s\\nrunning on, so it might be different for you. But you should check that the version number,\\nwhich is 3.4.0 in this example, begins with 3, which indicates that you are running Python\\n3. If it begins with 2, you are running (you guessed it) Python 2.\\nThe last line is a prompt that indicates that the interpreter is ready for you to enter code. If\\nyou type a line of code and hit Enter, the interpreter displays the result:\\n>>> 1 + 1\\n2\\nNow you\\x92re ready to get started. From here on, I assume that you know how to start the\\nPython interpreter and run code.\\n\\x0c1.3. The ?rst program\\n1.3 The ?rst program\\n3\\nTraditionally, the ?rst program you write in a new language is called \\x93Hello, World!\\x94 be-\\ncause all it does is display the words \\x93Hello, World!\\x94. In Python, it looks like this:\\n>>> print(\\'Hello, World!\\')\\nThis is an example of a print statement, although it doesn\\x92t actually print anything on\\npaper. It displays a result on the screen. In this case, the result is the words\\nHello, World!\\nThe quotation marks in the program mark the beginning and end of the text to be dis-\\nplayed; they don\\x92t appear in the result.\\nThe parentheses indicate that print is a function. We\\x92ll get to functions in Chapter 3.\\nIn Python 2, the print statement is slightly different; it is not a function, so it doesn\\x92t use\\nparentheses.\\n>>> print \\'Hello, World!\\'\\nThis distinction will make more sense soon, but that\\x92s enough to get started.\\n1.4 Arithmetic operators\\nAfter \\x93Hello, World\\x94, the next step is arithmetic. Python provides operators, which are\\nspecial symbols that represent computations like addition and multiplication.\\nThe operators +, -, and * perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication, as in the fol-\\nlowing examples:\\n>>> 40 + 2\\n42\\n>>> 43 - 1\\n42\\n>>> 6 * 7\\n42\\nThe operator / performs division:\\n>>> 84 / 2\\n42.0\\nYou might wonder why the result is 42.0 instead of 42. I\\x92ll explain in the next section.\\nFinally, the operator ** performs exponentiation; that is, it raises a number to a power:\\n>>> 6**2 + 6\\n42\\nIn some other languages, ^ is used for exponentiation, but in Python it is a bitwise operator\\ncalled XOR. If you are not familiar with bitwise operators, the result will surprise you:\\n>>> 6 ^ 2\\n4\\nI won\\x92t cover bitwise operators in this book, but you can read about them at http://wiki.\\npython.org/moin/BitwiseOperators.\\n\\x0c4\\nChapter 1. The way of the program\\n1.5 Values and types\\nA value is one of the basic things a program works with, like a letter or a number. Some\\nvalues we have seen so far are 2, 42.0, and \\'Hello, World!\\'.\\nThese values belong to different types: 2 is an integer, 42.0 is a ?oating-point number, and\\n\\'Hello, World!\\' is a string, so-called because the letters it contains are strung together.\\nIf you are not sure what type a value has, the interpreter can tell you:\\n>>> type(2)\\n<class \\'int\\'>\\n>>> type(42.0)\\n<class \\'float\\'>\\n>>> type(\\'Hello, World!\\')\\n<class \\'str\\'>\\nIn these results, the word \\x93class\\x94 is used in the sense of a category; a type is a category of\\nvalues.\\nNot surprisingly, integers belong to the type int, strings belong to str and ?oating-point\\nnumbers belong to float.\\nWhat about values like \\'2\\' and \\'42.0\\'? They look like numbers, but they are in quotation\\nmarks like strings.\\n>>> type(\\'2\\')\\n<class \\'str\\'>\\n>>> type(\\'42.0\\')\\n<class \\'str\\'>\\nThey\\x92re strings.\\nWhen you type a large integer, you might be tempted to use commas between groups of\\ndigits, as in 1,000,000. This is not a legal integer in Python, but it is legal:\\n>>> 1,000,000\\n(1, 0, 0)\\nThat\\x92s not what we expected at all! Python interprets 1,000,000 as a comma-separated\\nsequence of integers. We\\x92ll learn more about this kind of sequence later.\\n1.6 Formal and natural languages\\nNatural languages are the languages people speak, such as English, Spanish, and French.\\nThey were not designed by people (although people try to impose some order on them);',\n",

This way of think-\\ning combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science.\\nLike mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas (speci?-\\ncally computations). Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into sys-\\ntems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the behav-\\nior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions.\\nThe single most important skill for a computer scientist is problem solving. Problem solv-\\ning means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express\\na solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an\\nexcellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills. That\\x92s why this chapter is called,\\n\\x93The way of the program\\x94.\\nOn one level, you will be learning to program, a useful skill by itself. On another level, you\\nwill use programming as a means to an end. As we go along, that end will become clearer.\\n1.1 What is a program?\\nA program is a sequence of instructions that speci?es how to perform a computation. The\\ncomputation might be something mathematical, such as solving a system of equations or\\n?nding the roots of a polynomial, but it can also be a symbolic computation, such as search-\\ning and replacing text in a document or something graphical, like processing an image or\\nplaying a video.\\nThe details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just\\nabout every language:\\ninput: Get data from the keyboard, a ?le, the network, or some other device.\\noutput: Display data on the screen, save it in a ?le, send it over the network, etc.\\nmath: Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication.\\nconditional execution: Check for certain conditions and run the appropriate code.\\n\\x0c2\\nChapter 1. The way of the program\\nrepetition: Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.\\nBelieve it or not, that\\x92s pretty much all there is to it. Every program you\\x92ve ever used,\\nno matter how complicated, is made up of instructions that look pretty much like these.\\nSo you can think of programming as the process of breaking a large, complex task into\\nsmaller and smaller subtasks until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with\\none of these basic instructions.\\n1.2 Running Python\\nOne of the challenges of getting started with Python is that you might have to install\\nPython and related software on your computer. If you are familiar with your operating\\nsystem, and especially if you are comfortable with the command-line interface, you will\\nhave no trouble installing Python. But for beginners, it can be painful to learn about sys-\\ntem administration and programming at the same time.\\nTo avoid that problem, I recommend that you start out running Python in a browser. Later,\\nwhen you are comfortable with Python, I\\x92ll make suggestions for installing Python on your\\ncomputer.\\nThere are a number of web pages you can use to run Python. If you already have a fa-\\nvorite, go ahead and use it. Otherwise I recommend PythonAnywhere.

So the total output looks like this:\\n3\\n2\\n1\\nBlastoff!\\nAs a second example, we\\x92ll rewrite the methods newLine and threeLine from\\nSection 4.1. Here they are again:\\npublic static void newLine() {\\nSystem.out.println();\\n}\\npublic static void threeLine() {\\nnewLine();\\nnewLine();\\nnewLine();\\n}\\nAlthough these methods work, they would not help if we wanted to display two\\nnewlines, or maybe 100.

The\\nstructure is similar to countdown. As long as n is greater than 0, it displays\\na newline and then invokes itself to display (n ? 1) additional newlines. The\\ntotal number of newlines is 1 + (n ? 1), which is just what we wanted: n.\\n8.2 Recursive Stack Diagrams\\nIn Section 4.5, we used a stack diagram to represent the state of a program\\nduring a method invocation. The same kind of diagram can make it easier to\\ninterpret a recursive method.\\nRemember that every time a method gets called, Java creates a new frame\\nthat contains the method\\x92s parameters and variables. Figure ?? is a stack\\ndiagram for countdown, called with n == 3.\\nFigure 8.1: Stack diagram for the countdown program.\\nBy convention, the frame for main is at the top, and the stack of other frames\\ngrows down. That way, we can draw stack diagrams on paper without needing\\nto guess how far they will grow. The frame for main is empty because main\\ncountdowncountdownmaincountdowncountdown3210nnnn\\x0c130\\nChapter 8 Recursive Methods\\ndoes not have any variables. (It has the parameter args, but since we\\x92re not\\nusing it, we left it out of the diagram.)\\nThere are four frames for countdown, each with a different value for the pa-\\nrameter n. The last frame, with n == 0, is called the base case. It does not\\nmake a recursive call, so there are no more frames below it.\\nIf there is no base case in a recursive method, or if the base case is never\\nreached, the stack would grow forever\\x97at least in theory. In practice, the size\\nof the stack is limited. If you exceed the limit, you get a StackOverflowError.\\nFor example, here is a recursive method without a base case:\\npublic static void forever(String s) {\\nSystem.out.println(s);\\nforever(s);\\n}\\nThis method displays the given string until the stack overflows, at which point\\nit throws an error. Try this example on your computer\\x97you might be surprised\\nby how long the error message is!\\n8.3 Value-Returning Methods\\nTo give you an idea of what you can do with the tools you have learned, let\\x92s\\nlook at methods that evaluate recursively defined mathematical functions.\\nA recursive definition is similar to a \\x93circular\\x94 definition, in the sense that\\nthe definition refers to the thing being defined. Of course, a truly circular\\ndefinition is not very useful:\\nrecursive:\\nAn adjective used to describe a method that is recursive.\\nIf you saw that definition in the dictionary, you might be annoyed. Then again,\\nif you search for \\x93recursion\\x94 on Google, it displays \\x93Did you mean: recursion\\x94\\nas an inside joke. People fall for that link all the time.\\n\\x0c8.3 Value-Returning Methods\\n131\\nMany mathematical functions are defined recursively, because that is often the\\nsimplest way. For example, the factorial of an integer n, which is written n!,\\nis defined like this:\\n0! = 1\\nn! = n · (n ? 1)!\\nDon\\x92t confuse the mathematical symbol !, which means factorial, with the\\nJava operator !, which means not. This definition says that factorial(0) is\\n1, and factorial(n) is n * factorial(n - 1).\\nSo factorial(3) is 3 * factorial(2); factorial(2) is 2 * factorial(1);\\nfactorial(1) is 1 * factorial(0); and factorial(0) is 1. Putting it all\\ntogether, we get 3 * 2 * 1 * 1, which is 6.\\nIf you can formulate a recursive definition of something, you can easily write\\na Java method to evaluate it. The first step is to decide what the parameters\\nand return type are. Since factorial is defined for integers, the method takes\\nan int as a parameter and returns an int:\\npublic static int factorial(int n) {\\n// stub\\nreturn 0;\\n}\\nNext, we think about the base case.',\n",

Downey\\nGreen Tea Press\\nNeedham, Massachusetts\\n\\x0cCopyright c(cid:13) 2014 Allen B. Downey.\\nGreen Tea Press\\n9 Washburn Ave\\nNeedham MA 02492\\nPermission is granted to copy, distribute, and/or modify this document under\\nthe terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike\\n4.0 International License, which is available at http://creativecommons.\\norg/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/.\\nThe LATEX source for this book is available from http://think-dsp.com.\\n\\x0cPreface\\nSignal processing is one of my favorite topics.\\nIt is useful in many areas\\nof science and engineering, and if you understand the fundamental ideas, it\\nprovides insight into many things we see in the world, and especially the things\\nwe hear.\\nBut unless you studied electrical or mechanical engineering, you probably\\nhaven\\x92t had a chance to learn about signal processing. The problem is that\\nmost books (and the classes that use them) present the material bottom-up,\\nstarting with mathematical abstractions like phasors. And they tend to be\\ntheoretical, with few applications and little apparent relevance.\\nThe premise of this book is that if you know how to program, you can use\\nthat skill to learn other things, and have fun doing it.\\nWith a programming-based approach, I can present the most important ideas\\nright away. By the end of the ?rst chapter, you can analyze sound recordings\\nand other signals, and generate new sounds. Each chapter introduces a new\\ntechnique and an application you can apply to real signals. At each step you\\nlearn how to use a technique ?rst, and then how it works.\\nThis approach is more practical and, I hope you\\x92ll agree, more fun.\\n0.1 Who is this book for?\\nThe examples and supporting code for this book are in Python. You should\\nknow core Python and you should be familiar with object-oriented features,\\nat least using objects if not de?ning your own.\\nIf you are not already familiar with Python, you might want to start with\\nmy other book, Think Python, which is an introduction to Python for people\\nwho have never programmed, or Mark Lutz\\x92s Learning Python, which might\\nbe better for people with programming experience.\\n\\x0cvi\\nChapter 0. Preface\\nI use NumPy and SciPy extensively. If you are familiar with them already,\\nthat\\x92s great, but I will also explain the functions and data structures I use.\\nI assume that the reader knows basic mathematics, including complex num-\\nbers. You don\\x92t need much calculus; if you understand the concepts of inte-\\ngration and di?erentiation, that will do. I use some linear algebra, but I will\\nexplain it as we go along.\\n0.2 Using the code\\nThe code and sound samples used in this book are available from https:\\n//github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkDSP. Git is a version control system that\\nallows you to keep track of the ?les that make up a project. A collection of\\n?les under Git\\x92s control is called a \\x93repository\\x94. GitHub is a hosting service\\nthat provides storage for Git repositories and a convenient web interface.\\nThe GitHub homepage for my repository provides several ways to work with\\nthe code:\\n\\x95 You can create a copy of my repository on GitHub by pressing the Fork\\nbutton.\\nIf you don\\x92t already have a GitHub account, you\\x92ll need to\\ncreate one. After forking, you\\x92ll have your own repository on GitHub\\nthat you can use to keep track of code you write while working on this\\nbook. Then you can clone the repo, which means that you copy the ?les\\nto your computer.\\n\\x95 Or you could clone my repository. You don\\x92t need a GitHub account to\\ndo this, but you won\\x92t be able to write your changes back to GitHub.\\n\\x95 If you don\\x92t want to use Git at all, you can download the ?les in a Zip\\n?le using the button in the lower-right corner of the GitHub page.\\nAll of the code is written to work in both Python 2 and Python 3 with no\\ntranslation.\\nI developed this book using Anaconda from Continuum Analytics, which is a\\nfree Python distribution that includes all the packages you\\x92ll need to run the\\ncode (and lots more). I found Anaconda easy to install. By default it does\\na user-level installation, not system-level, so you don\\x92t need administrative\\nprivileges. And it supports both Python 2 and Python 3. You can download\\nAnaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/.\\nIf you don\\x92t want to use Anaconda, you will need the following packages:\\n\\x0c0.2. Using the code\\nvii\\n\\x95 NumPy for basic numerical computation, http://www.numpy.org/;\\n\\x95 SciPy for scienti?c computation, http://www.scipy.org/;\\n\\x95 matplotlib for visualization, http://matplotlib.org/.\\nAlthough these are commonly used packages, they are not included with all\\nPython installations, and they can be hard to install in some environments. If\\nyou have trouble installing them, I recommend using Anaconda or one of the\\nother Python distributions that include these packages.\\nMost exercises use Python scripts, but some also use Jupyter notebooks. If you\\nhave not used Jupyter before, you can read about it at http://jupyter.org.\\nThere are three ways you can work with the Jupyter notebooks:\\nRun Jupyter on your computer If you installed Anaconda, you probably\\ngot Jupyter by default. To check, start the server from the command\\nline, like this:\\n$ jupyter notebook\\nIf it\\x92s not installed, you can install it in Anaconda like this:\\n$ conda install jupyter\\nWhen you start the server, it should launch your default web browser or',\n",

      "### Python Function Definition\n",
      "\n",
      "In Python, a function is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the name of the function and parentheses containing any parameters. The function body consists of a sequence of statements that define its functionality. Here’s a basic structure:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def function_name(parameters):\n",
      "    \"\"\"Optional docstring\"\"\"\n",
      "    # Body of the function\n",
      "    # More code to define what the function does\n",
      "    return result  # Optional return statement\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Example\n",
      "Here’s a simple example of a function that adds two numbers:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def add_numbers(a, b):\n",
      "    return a + b\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "You can call this function like so:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "result = add_numbers(5, 3)  # result will be 8\n",
      "``` \n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Components:\n",
      "1. **Function Name**: `add_numbers` is the name identifying the function.\n",
      "2. **Parameters**: `a` and `b` are parameters that the function takes.\n",
      "3. **Body**: The indented lines form the body of the function, executing the return statement when it’s called.\n",
      "4. **Return Value**: The `return` statement sends back a value from the function to where it was called.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can define functions that take any number of parameters, and functions may not return a value (those are called void functions). Python also allows for default parameters and keyword arguments, providing flexibility in how functions can be called. \n",
      "\n",
      "For further reading on functions, refer to Chapter 3 of the course material, which will provide more detailed insights into creating and utilizing functions in Python.\n"
